python_client_socket_chat
=========================


This code basically is designed to run Client and Server on the same PC.


This server client chat will work on both windows and linux.

Incase if it doesnot work, Please switch off the firewall in Windows and Linux respectively, such that the OS dosent prevent the Port acess.


NOTE:

* Run the SERVER code first, since a Port must be open before making a connection to it.
 
* Then run the client code.
 
* If the server resides on a different PC in a network, provide the IP address of the server.
 
* you have to add your own WHILE loops to continue receiving and sending messages without exiting the code.
